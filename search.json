    "title": "Were the Minnesota Vikings the most unorthodox team in the 2022 season?",
    "section": "",
    "text": "The Minnesota Vikings may have had one of the craziest seasons of all time last season. To give a brief overview, they won the NFC North, finished with a 13-4 record, and completed the largest comeback in NFL history, defeating the Indianapolis Colts 39-36, after going down 33-0 at halftime.\nThe million-dollar question that I used different graphs and data from Pro Football Reference to find the answer to is: Were the Minnesota Vikings the most unorthodox team in the NFL last season? My simple answer: yes. It is a miracle they won as many games as they did because based off the numbers they produced; they should have been maybe .500, but definitely not 13-4. They had one of the worst defenses in the NFL and having Kirk Cousins as their quarterback doesn’t help matters much either. In attempt to prove my prediction that the Vikings are the most unorthodox team to play in the 2022 season, I made three different charts. The first being about the number of points allowed by each team in the NFL (on the y-axis) and the number of points scored on the x axis. This accurately showed the Vikings sitting at the very top of the graph, proving while they did score a good number of points, they gave up a ton.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(ggrepel)\nlibrary(ggalt)\nlibrary(ggtext)\n\nteamrecord <- read_csv(\"teamrecord.csv\")\nvikingstats <- teamrecord %>% filter(Tm == \"Minnesota Vikings\")\nwinners <-  teamrecord %>% filter(W >= 13) %>% filter(Tm != \"Minnesota Vikings\")\n\nnfloffense <- read_csv(\"nfloffense\")\n\nnfldefense <- read_csv(\"nfldefense_csv\")\n\nggplot() + \n  geom_point(\n    data=teamrecord, \n    aes(x=PF, y=PA, size=W), \n    color=\"grey\", \n    alpha=.4) + \n  geom_point(\n    data=vikingstats, \n    aes(x=PF, y=PA, size=W), \n    color=\"purple\") + \n  geom_text_repel(\n    data=vikingstats, \n    aes(x=PF, y=PA + 12.5, label=Tm)\n  )+ \n  geom_point(\n    data=winners, \n    aes(x=PF, y=PA, size=W), \n    color=\"black\",\n     alpha=.5) +\n  geom_text_repel(\n    data=winners, \n    aes(x=PF, y=PA + 12.5, label=Tm) \n  ) +\n  labs(\n    x=\"Points Scored\", \n    y=\"Points Allowed\", \n    title=\"The gap between the Vikings and teams with a chance to go far\", \n    subtitle=\"Although Minnesota scored a lot of points, they gave up close to the most in the NFL.\", \n    caption=\"Source: Pro Football Reference | By Avery Peck\"\n    )+\ntheme_classic() +\n  theme(\n     plot.title.position = \"plot\",\n     plot.title=element_text(size=16, face = \"bold\"),\n     plot.subtitle= element_text(size=11)\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\nThough they were on the higher end of points scored, Minnesota allowed the third most points in the entirety of the season. This proves just how bad their defense was and how they could rarely stop anyone from scoring a touchdown.\n\n\nCode\nOFturnovers<- nfloffense %>% select(Tm, TO) %>% rename(OffensiveTurnovers=TO)\nDefturnovers<- nfldefense %>% select(Tm, TO) %>%  rename(DefensiveTurnovers=TO)\nturnovers <- OFturnovers %>% inner_join(Defturnovers)\nvikingturnovers <- turnovers %>% filter(Tm == \"Minnesota Vikings\")\n\nggplot() + \n  geom_dumbbell(\n    data=turnovers, \n    aes(y=reorder(Tm, DefensiveTurnovers), x=DefensiveTurnovers, xend=OffensiveTurnovers),\n    size = 2,\n    colour = \"grey\",\n    colour_x = \"#013220\",\n    colour_xend = \"#8b0000\") +\n  geom_dumbbell(\n    data=vikingturnovers, \n    aes(y=reorder(Tm, DefensiveTurnovers), x=DefensiveTurnovers, xend=OffensiveTurnovers),\n    size = 2,\n    colour = \"purple\",\n    colour_x = \"#013220\",\n    colour_xend = \"#8b0000\") +\n  theme(\n    plot.subtitle = element_textbox_simple()\n  ) +\n  labs(\n    x= \"Turnovers\", \n    y= \"\", \n    title=\"Offensive and Defensive Turnovers\", \n    subtitle =\"When the defense <span style = 'color:#013220;'>takes the ball away</span> more than the offense <span style = 'color:#8b0000;'>gives the ball away,</span> they usually win.\",\n    caption=\"Source: Pro Football Reference | By Avery Peck\"\n    ) + \n  theme_classic() +\n  theme(\n     plot.title.position = \"plot\",\n     plot.title=element_text(size=16, face = \"bold\"),\n     plot.subtitle= element_textbox_simple(size=11)\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Vikings were however on the lower end of turnovers, both offensively and defensively. This can be a good or bad thing, depending how you choose to look at it. They didn’t turn the ball over a whole lot, but their defense didn’t cause the other team to turn the ball over a whole lot either.\n\n\nCode\nggplot() + \n  geom_bar(data=teamrecord, aes(x= reorder(Tm, PD), weight=PD), fill= \"light grey\") +\n  geom_bar(data=winners, aes(x= reorder(Tm, PD), weight=PD), fill=\"dark grey\") +\n  geom_bar(data=vikingstats, aes(x= reorder(Tm, PD), weight=PD), fill=\"purple\") +\n  geom_text(aes(x=\"Minnesota Vikings\", y=67, label=\"<- This team made the playoffs\")) +\n  coord_flip()  +\n  labs(\n      x= \"\",\n      y=\"Point Differential\",\n    title= \"The Vikes had a negative point differential, yet won 13 games\",\n    subtitle=\"They won 13 games for the second time in franchise history. But, Minnesota was also outscored by a \\nfield goal over the course of the 2022-2023 season.\", caption=\"Source: Pro Football Reference | By Avery Peck\"\n  ) +\n    theme_classic() +\n    theme( \n     plot.title.position = \"plot\",\n     plot.title=element_text(size=16, face = \"bold\"),\n     plot.subtitle= element_text(size=11)\n    )\n\n\n\n\n\nOne of the craziest things I found was the point differential. An example of a normal point differential with a good team is the Philadelphia Eagles. They ended with a 14-3 record and finished with a point differential of 133. Normal. Now, the Minnesota Vikings on the other hand, ended the season with a 13-4 record, yet their point differential was -3. This means they were outscored by a field goal. How they managed to win 13 games is beyond me.\nBy all the data I have found, my question of were the Vikings the most unorthodox team in the NFL in the 2022 season was correct. I don’t know why or how they were able to win so many games, that remains a mystery to me, but they definitely did not deserve 13 wins."

    "title": "Do the New MLB Rules Have a Large Effect on the Game?",
    "section": "",
    "text": "The new MLB rules have had more of an effect on the game than people think. There are three new rules that have been implemented into the 2023 season. The first rule being a new pitch clock to help the game go a lot smoother and quicker. The second rule is the shift change. All four infielders must have their feet inside the dirt when the pitcher begins his windup. This is to ensure there are more hits in MLB games because a game with no offense can be very boring and won’t bring in more people to future games. The third and final new rule was implementing bigger bases. The bases have been 15 inches in the past, now they have changed to 18 inches. This is to ensure that collisions don’t happen when someone is sliding into a base, and it makes it easier for players to steal bases. These three new rules have been changing the games already, just one month into the new season.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(patchwork)\n\nattendance2023 <- read_csv(\"attendance2023.csv\") %>% mutate(Season = 2023)\nattendance2022 <- read_csv(\"attendance2022.csv\") %>% mutate(Season = 2022)\nattendance2021 <- read_csv(\"attendance21.csv\") %>% mutate(Season = 2021) %>% mutate(Tm = case_when(Tm == \"Cleveland Indians\" ~ \"Cleveland Guardians\", TRUE ~ Tm))\nattendance2020 <- read_csv(\"attendance20.csv\") %>% mutate(Season = 2020) %>% mutate(Tm = case_when(Tm == \"Cleveland Indians\" ~ \"Cleveland Guardians\", TRUE ~ Tm))\nattendance2019 <- read_csv(\"attendance19.csv\") %>% mutate(Season = 2019) %>% mutate(Tm = case_when(Tm == \"Cleveland Indians\" ~ \"Cleveland Guardians\", TRUE ~ Tm))\n\nattendance <- bind_rows(attendance2023, attendance2022, attendance2021, attendance2020, attendance2019)\n\nggplot() + \n  geom_line(data=attendance, aes(x=Season, y=Time, group=Tm)) + \n  scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(2019, 2022)) + \n  facet_wrap(~Tm) +\n labs(\n      x= \"Season\",\n      y=\"Game Length\",\n    title= \"Game lengths in the MLB decreased in the 2023 season\",\n    subtitle=\"Due to the new pitch clock, MLB games are being finished in a much shorter amount of time.\", caption=\"Source: Pro Baseball Reference | By Avery Peck\"\n  ) +\n    theme_classic() +\n    theme( \n     plot.title.position = \"plot\",\n     plot.title=element_text(size=16, face = \"bold\"),\n     plot.subtitle= element_text(size=11),\n     strip.text.x = element_text(size=6.75)\n    )\n\n\n\n\n\nThe pitch clock has heavily impacted the time of the game, with the time of each game going down from about 3 hours and 15 minutes, to around 2 and a half hours. What this new pitch clock rule entails is a pitcher has 15 seconds (if there is no runner on base) to pitch the ball or 20 seconds if there is a runner on base. The batter must be in the box once the clock is at 8 seconds and if he isn’t, it’s an automatic strike. If the pitcher is the one to mess up, it is an automatic ball. It does not matter the count, or if the pitch will make it strike three or ball four. This rule was implemented to speed up the games as most people do not care to sit at a baseball field for four plus hours.\n\n\nCode\nadvbatting22 <- read_csv(\"advbatting2022.csv\") %>% mutate(Season = 2022)\nadvbatting23 <- read_csv(\"advbatting2023.csv\")%>% mutate(Season = 2023)\nadvbatting <- bind_rows(advbatting22, advbatting23) %>% mutate(`GB%` = as.numeric(gsub(\"%\", \"\", `GB%`)))\n\nLAD <- advbatting %>% filter(Tm == \"Los Angeles Dodgers\")\nMN <- advbatting %>%  filter(Tm == \"Minnesota Twins\")\nASTROS <- advbatting %>% filter(Tm == \"Houston Astros\")\nMARLINS <- advbatting %>% filter(Tm == \"Miami Marlins\")\n\nshiftteams <- bind_rows(LAD, MN, ASTROS, MARLINS)\n\n\nggplot() + \n  geom_line(data=advbatting, aes(x=Season, y=`GB%`, group=Tm), color=\"grey\") +\n  geom_point(data=advbatting, aes(x=Season, y=`GB%`, group=Tm), color=\"grey\") +\n  geom_line(data= LAD, aes(x=Season, y=`GB%`, group=Tm), color=\"#ADD8E6\") +\n  geom_point(data=LAD, aes(x=Season, y=`GB%`, group=Tm), color=\"#ADD8E6\") +\n  geom_line(data=MN, aes(x=Season, y=`GB%`, group=Tm), color=\"#000080\") +\n  geom_point(data=MN, aes(x=Season, y=`GB%`, group=Tm), color=\"#000080\") +\n  geom_line(data=ASTROS, aes(x=Season, y=`GB%`, group=Tm), color=\"#FFA500\") +\n  geom_point(data=ASTROS, aes(x=Season, y=`GB%`, group=Tm), color=\"#FFA500\")  +\n  geom_point(data=MARLINS, aes(x=Season, y=`GB%`, group=Tm), color=\"#FF0000\") +\n  geom_line(data=MARLINS, aes(x=Season, y=`GB%`, group=Tm), color=\"#FF0000\") +\n  geom_text(data=shiftteams %>% filter(Season == max(2023)), aes(x=Season + .2, y=`GB%`+.1, group=Tm, label=Tm)) + \n  scale_x_continuous(breaks=c(2022, 2023), limits=c(2021.9,2023.35)) +\n\n labs(\n      x= \" \",\n      y=\"Ground Ball Percentage\",\n    title= \"Players are hitting more ground balls for basehits this season.\",\n    subtitle= \"With the new shift disallowing the defenseive infielders to play past the infield dirt and forcing them to have \\ntwo infielders on either side of second base, it's easier for hitters to get ground ball hits.\", caption=\"Source: Pro Baseball Reference | By Avery Peck\"\n  ) +\n    theme_classic() +\n    theme( \n     plot.title.position = \"plot\",\n     plot.title=element_text(size=16, face = \"bold\"),\n     plot.subtitle= element_text(size=11)\n    )\n\n\n\n\n\nAnother rule implemented in the 2023 season was a “shift change” rule. This rule states that all four infielders must be inside the infield dirt with two fielders on each side of second base. This rule was put in place so that there can be more hits in games because without any offense, baseball can be incredibly boring. So far, in the 2023 season, there has not been a significant change in ground balls being hit for base hits due to the shift change, but there is a lot of time left to go.\n\n\nCode\nSB2023 <- read_csv(\"stolenbasepct2023.csv\") %>% \n  mutate(`SB%` = as.numeric(gsub(\"%\", \"\", `SB%`))) %>% \n  select(Tm, `SB%`) %>%\n  mutate(`CS%` = 100-`SB%`, Order = `SB%`) %>% \n  pivot_longer(\n  cols=c(-\"Tm\", -\"Order\"),\n  names_to=\"Stat\", \n  values_to=\"Percent\") %>%\n  na.omit() %>%\n  filter(Tm != \"League Average\")\n\nSB2022 <- read_csv(\"stolenbasepct2022.csv\")%>% \n  mutate(`SB%` = as.numeric(gsub(\"%\", \"\", `SB%`))) %>% \n  mutate(`SB%`= (SB/(SB + CS))*100) %>% \n  select(Tm, `SB%`) %>%\n  mutate(`CS%` = 100-`SB%`, Order = `SB%`) %>% \n  pivot_longer(\n  cols=c(-\"Tm\", -\"Order\"),\n  names_to=\"Stat\", \n  values_to=\"Percent\") %>%\n  na.omit() %>%\n  filter(Tm != \"League Average\")\n\nbar1 <-ggplot() + \n  geom_bar(data=SB2023, aes(x=reorder(Tm, Order), weight=Percent, fill=Stat )) + \n  coord_flip() + \n  scale_fill_manual(values=c(\"grey\", \"purple\")) + \n  theme(\n    legend.position = \"none\"\n  ) +\n  labs(\n      x= \"\",\n      y=\"Stolen Base Percentage\",\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal()  + \n  theme(\n    legend.position = \"none\"\n  )\n\nbar2 <- ggplot() + \n  geom_bar(data=SB2022, aes(x=reorder(Tm, Order), weight=Percent, fill=Stat )) + \n  coord_flip()  + \n  scale_fill_manual(values=c(\"grey\", \"purple\")) +\n  labs(\n      x= \"\",\n      y=\"Stolen Base Percentage\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() + \n  theme(\n    legend.position = \"none\"\n  )\n\n(bar1 + bar2) +\n  plot_annotation(\n    title= \"Players have an easier time stealing bases in the 2023 season.\",\n    subtitle= \"It is easier to steal bases when they are three inches bigger than before.\", caption=\"Source: Pro Baseball Reference | By Avery Peck\",\n    theme = theme(plot.title=element_text(size=16, face = \"bold\")) + theme(plot.title=element_text(size=16, face = \"bold\"))\n    )\n\n\n\n\n\nLastly, the bases were made three inches bigger than in previous seasons. This is to prevent collisions between a fielder and a when a base runner is sliding into a base, and it also makes it a little bit easier for runners to steal bases. It can make things a lot easier for a base runner and a fielder can make a lot cleaner of a play. Overall, the new MLB rules do have an effect on the game today. Games are being played a lot quicker than they used to, infielders cannot shift past the dirt, and the bases have been made three inches bigger to ensure safety when sliding plays occur."
