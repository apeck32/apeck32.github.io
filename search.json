    "section": "",
    "text": "The Minnesota Vikings may have had one of the craziest seasons of all time last season. To give a brief overview, they won the NFC North, finished with a 13-4 record, and completed the largest comeback in NFL history, defeating the Indianapolis Colts 39-36, after going down 33-0 at halftime.\nThe million-dollar question that I used different graphs and data from Pro Football Reference to find the answer to is: Were the Minnesota Vikings the most unorthodox team in the NFL last season? My simple answer: yes. It is a miracle they won as many games as they did because based off the numbers they produced; they should have been maybe .500, but definitely not 13-4. They had one of the worst defenses in the NFL and having Kirk Cousins as their quarterback doesn’t help matters much either. In attempt to prove my prediction that the Vikings are the most unorthodox team to play in the 2022 season, I made three different charts. The first being about the number of points allowed by each team in the NFL (on the y-axis) and the number of points scored on the x axis. This accurately showed the Vikings sitting at the very top of the graph, proving while they did score a good number of points, they gave up a ton.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(ggrepel)\nlibrary(ggalt)\nlibrary(ggtext)\n\nteamrecord <- read_csv(\"teamrecord.csv\")\nvikingstats <- teamrecord %>% filter(Tm == \"Minnesota Vikings\")\nwinners <-  teamrecord %>% filter(W >= 13) %>% filter(Tm != \"Minnesota Vikings\")\n\nnfloffense <- read_csv(\"nfloffense\")\n\nnfldefense <- read_csv(\"nfldefense_csv\")\n\nggplot() + \n  geom_point(\n    data=teamrecord, \n    aes(x=PF, y=PA, size=W), \n    color=\"grey\", \n    alpha=.4) + \n  geom_point(\n    data=vikingstats, \n    aes(x=PF, y=PA, size=W), \n    color=\"purple\") + \n  geom_text_repel(\n    data=vikingstats, \n    aes(x=PF, y=PA + 12.5, label=Tm)\n  )+ \n  geom_point(\n    data=winners, \n    aes(x=PF, y=PA, size=W), \n    color=\"black\",\n     alpha=.5) +\n  geom_text_repel(\n    data=winners, \n    aes(x=PF, y=PA + 12.5, label=Tm) \n  ) +\n  labs(\n    x=\"Points Scored\", \n    y=\"Points Allowed\", \n    title=\"The gap between the Vikings and teams with a chance to go far\", \n    subtitle=\"Although Minnesota scored a lot of points, they gave up close to the most in the NFL.\", \n    caption=\"Source: Pro Football Reference | By Avery Peck\"\n    )+\ntheme_classic() +\n  theme(\n     plot.title.position = \"plot\",\n     plot.title=element_text(size=16, face = \"bold\"),\n     plot.subtitle= element_text(size=11)\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\nThough they were on the higher end of points scored, Minnesota allowed the third most points in the entirety of the season. This proves just how bad their defense was and how they could rarely stop anyone from scoring a touchdown.\n\n\nCode\nOFturnovers<- nfloffense %>% select(Tm, TO) %>% rename(OffensiveTurnovers=TO)\nDefturnovers<- nfldefense %>% select(Tm, TO) %>%  rename(DefensiveTurnovers=TO)\nturnovers <- OFturnovers %>% inner_join(Defturnovers)\nvikingturnovers <- turnovers %>% filter(Tm == \"Minnesota Vikings\")\n\nggplot() + \n  geom_dumbbell(\n    data=turnovers, \n    aes(y=reorder(Tm, DefensiveTurnovers), x=DefensiveTurnovers, xend=OffensiveTurnovers),\n    size = 2,\n    colour = \"grey\",\n    colour_x = \"#013220\",\n    colour_xend = \"#8b0000\") +\n  geom_dumbbell(\n    data=vikingturnovers, \n    aes(y=reorder(Tm, DefensiveTurnovers), x=DefensiveTurnovers, xend=OffensiveTurnovers),\n    size = 2,\n    colour = \"purple\",\n    colour_x = \"#013220\",\n    colour_xend = \"#8b0000\") +\n  theme(\n    plot.subtitle = element_textbox_simple()\n  ) +\n  labs(\n    x= \"Turnovers\", \n    y= \"\", \n    title=\"Offensive and Defensive Turnovers\", \n    subtitle =\"When the defense <span style = 'color:#013220;'>takes the ball away</span> more than the offense <span style = 'color:#8b0000;'>gives the ball away,</span> they usually win.\",\n    caption=\"Source: Pro Football Reference | By Avery Peck\"\n    ) + \n  theme_classic() +\n  theme(\n     plot.title.position = \"plot\",\n     plot.title=element_text(size=16, face = \"bold\"),\n     plot.subtitle= element_textbox_simple(size=11)\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Vikings were however on the lower end of turnovers, both offensively and defensively. This can be a good or bad thing, depending how you choose to look at it. They didn’t turn the ball over a whole lot, but their defense didn’t cause the other team to turn the ball over a whole lot either.\n\n\nCode\nggplot() + \n  geom_bar(data=teamrecord, aes(x= reorder(Tm, PD), weight=PD), fill= \"light grey\") +\n  geom_bar(data=winners, aes(x= reorder(Tm, PD), weight=PD), fill=\"dark grey\") +\n  geom_bar(data=vikingstats, aes(x= reorder(Tm, PD), weight=PD), fill=\"purple\") +\n  geom_text(aes(x=\"Minnesota Vikings\", y=67, label=\"<- This team made the playoffs\")) +\n  coord_flip()  +\n  labs(\n      x= \"\",\n      y=\"Point Differential\",\n    title= \"The Vikes had a negative point differential, yet won 13 games\",\n    subtitle=\"They won 13 games for the second time in franchise history. But, Minnesota was also outscored by a \\nfield goal over the course of the 2022-2023 season.\", caption=\"Source: Pro Football Reference | By Avery Peck\"\n  ) +\n    theme_classic() +\n    theme( \n     plot.title.position = \"plot\",\n     plot.title=element_text(size=16, face = \"bold\"),\n     plot.subtitle= element_text(size=11)\n    )\n\n\n\n\n\nOne of the craziest things I found was the point differential. An example of a normal point differential with a good team is the Philadelphia Eagles. They ended with a 14-3 record and finished with a point differential of 133. Normal. Now, the Minnesota Vikings on the other hand, ended the season with a 13-4 record, yet their point differential was -3. This means they were outscored by a field goal. How they managed to win 13 games is beyond me.\nBy all the data I have found, my question of were the Vikings the most unorthodox team in the NFL in the 2022 season was correct. I don’t know why or how they were able to win so many games, that remains a mystery to me, but they definitely did not deserve 13 wins."
