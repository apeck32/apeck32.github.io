    "text": "The Minnesota Vikings may have had one of the craziest seasons of all time last season. To give a brief overview, they won the NFC North, finished with a 13-4 record, and completed the largest comeback in NFL history, defeating the Indianapolis Colts 39-36, after going down 33-0 at halftime.\nThe million-dollar question that I used different graphs and data from Pro Football Reference to find the answer to is: Were the Minnesota Vikings the most unorthodox team in the NFL last season? My simple answer: yes. It is a miracle they won as many games as they did because based off the numbers they produced; they should have been maybe .500, but definitely not 13-4.\nThey had one of the worst defenses in the NFL and having Kirk Cousins as their quarterback doesn’t help matters much either.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(ggrepel)\nlibrary(ggalt)\nlibrary(ggtext)\n\nteamrecord <- read_csv(\"teamrecord.csv\")\nvikingstats <- teamrecord %>% filter(Tm == \"Minnesota Vikings\")\nwinners <-  teamrecord %>% filter(W >= 13) %>% filter(Tm != \"Minnesota Vikings\")\n\nnfloffense <- read_csv(\"nfloffense\")\n\nnfldefense <- read_csv(\"nfldefense_csv\")\n\nggplot() + \n  geom_point(\n    data=teamrecord, \n    aes(x=PF, y=PA, size=W), \n    color=\"grey\", \n    alpha=.4) + \n  geom_point(\n    data=vikingstats, \n    aes(x=PF, y=PA, size=W), \n    color=\"purple\") + \n  geom_text_repel(\n    data=vikingstats, \n    aes(x=PF, y=PA + 12.5, label=Tm)\n  )+ \n  geom_point(\n    data=winners, \n    aes(x=PF, y=PA, size=W), \n    color=\"black\",\n     alpha=.5) +\n  geom_text_repel(\n    data=winners, \n    aes(x=PF, y=PA + 12.5, label=Tm) \n  ) +\n  labs(\n    x=\"Points Scored\", \n    y=\"Points Allowed\", \n    title=\"The gap between the Vikings and teams with a chance to go far\", \n    subtitle=\"Although Minnesota scored a lot of points, they gave up close to the most in the NFL.\", \n    caption=\"Source: Pro Football Reference | By Avery Peck\"\n    )+\ntheme_classic() +\n  theme(\n     plot.title.position = \"plot\",\n     plot.title=element_text(size=16, face = \"bold\"),\n     plot.subtitle= element_text(size=11)\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\nelkjrglkdjfglkdjflgkjdflkjg\n\n\nCode\nOFturnovers<- nfloffense %>% select(Tm, TO) %>% rename(OffensiveTurnovers=TO)\nDefturnovers<- nfldefense %>% select(Tm, TO) %>%  rename(DefensiveTurnovers=TO)\nturnovers <- OFturnovers %>% inner_join(Defturnovers)\nvikingturnovers <- turnovers %>% filter(Tm == \"Minnesota Vikings\")\n\nggplot() + \n  geom_dumbbell(\n    data=turnovers, \n    aes(y=reorder(Tm, DefensiveTurnovers), x=DefensiveTurnovers, xend=OffensiveTurnovers),\n    size = 2,\n    colour = \"grey\",\n    colour_x = \"#013220\",\n    colour_xend = \"#8b0000\") +\n  geom_dumbbell(\n    data=vikingturnovers, \n    aes(y=reorder(Tm, DefensiveTurnovers), x=DefensiveTurnovers, xend=OffensiveTurnovers),\n    size = 2,\n    colour = \"purple\",\n    colour_x = \"#013220\",\n    colour_xend = \"#8b0000\") +\n  theme(\n    plot.subtitle = element_textbox_simple()\n  ) +\n  labs(\n    x= \"Turnovers\", \n    y= \"\", \n    title=\"Offensive and Defensive Turnovers\", \n    subtitle =\"When the defense <span style = 'color:#013220;'>takes the ball away</span> more than the offense <span style = 'color:#8b0000;'>gives the ball away,</span> they usually win.\",\n    caption=\"Source: Pro Football Reference | By Avery Peck\"\n    ) + \n  theme_classic() +\n  theme(\n     plot.title.position = \"plot\",\n     plot.title=element_text(size=16, face = \"bold\"),\n     plot.subtitle= element_textbox_simple(size=11)\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\nsldkjfgslknjvlkdjfglkdjfglkjd\n\n\nCode\nggplot() + \n  geom_bar(data=teamrecord, aes(x= reorder(Tm, PD), weight=PD), fill= \"light grey\") +\n  geom_bar(data=winners, aes(x= reorder(Tm, PD), weight=PD), fill=\"dark grey\") +\n  geom_bar(data=vikingstats, aes(x= reorder(Tm, PD), weight=PD), fill=\"purple\") +\n  geom_text(aes(x=\"Minnesota Vikings\", y=67, label=\"<- This team made the playoffs\")) +\n  coord_flip()  +\n  labs(\n      x= \"\",\n      y=\"Point Differential\",\n    title= \"The Vikes had a negative point differential, yet won 13 games\",\n    subtitle=\"They won 13 games for the second time in franchise history.
